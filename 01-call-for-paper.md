## Call For Papers

The XIII Majorov International Conference on Software Engineering and Computer Systems (**MICSECS-2021**) is an international event dedicated to discussing research results and directions in the areas related to Complex Computer Systems Design. Including but are not restricted to the following topics: Software and Hardware Engineering, Computational Platforms and Tools, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, performing and application of Artificial Intellect, modern UI/UX, Multimedia, Virtual and Extended Reality technologies.

The conference will be planed to be performed in a hybrid format with online and offline participation in Russia, Saint-Petersburg, ITMO University if the epidemic situation allows this.

### Important dates

All deadlines are for the Moscow time zone, 23:59.

* **The beginning of the participant registration**: 1 September 2021
* **Paper and Report submission deadline**: 1 October 2021 <!--- <s>1 October 2021</s> <b style="color: red;">10 November 2019</b>-->
* **Author notification**: 15 November 2021
* **Student Colloquium registration deadline**: 15 December 2021
* **Conference program publication**: 22 November 2021
* **Conference**: 1-3 December 2021
* **Camera-ready paper submission deadline**: 20 December 2021

### Submission Options

The conference gives a possibility to exchange their experience and results in perspective areas of research and engineering of complex computer systems. All types of participation are free. The program committee will carefully review all submissions. In 2020, we received 109 papers, and the acceptance rate was 0.65, 3.15 reviews per paper. 

#### Papers with Oral Presentation

Papers with oral presentations are dedicated to demonstrating the results of participant research and involve discussions with researchers in your area of interest, getting feedback, new ideas, and meetings. All accepted papers with oral presentation will be published in indexed by Scopus conference proceedings ([2020](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2893/), [2019](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2590/), [2018](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2344/)). Oral sections will be performing in English languages.

If you want to have additional networking, discussions, live demonstration or show a lot of technical details, you can also participate in poster or workshop sessions with the same paper.

#### Reports on Work in Progress or Pet Projects

Reports of work in progress and pet project dedicated to demonstrating the current state of ongoing or non-scientific projects for discussions, receiving feedback, and networking. That sections are mostly oriented on Ph.D., master, or bachelor students. A report should be presented by short oral presentation in English or Russian. All accepted reports will be published in conference proceedings and indexed by the RSCI database (TODO: LINK TO ARCHIVE/ABOUT PAGE).

If you want to have additional networking, discussions, live demonstration or show a lot of technical details, you can also participate in poster or workshop sessions with the same paper.

#### Student Colloquium 

Student Colloquium is a non-formal format that combines oral presentation and poster session elements in which participants can briefly overview their work and continue discussions with interested listeners. The section is held in rounds, each of which includes:

1. fast and dynamic pitches of several participants in a row without interruptions in the main showroom
2. at the pitches end, speakers are assigned to their stands, and listeners can freely move between them
3. after discussions, all participants return to the showroom
4. repeat

Participants need to pitch in English or Russian languages, and registration requires them to submit a short abstract in English languages, which is for publication on the conference site.

#### Poster and Workshop Sessions

Poster and workshop sessions are an additional format to present your research, work in process, or pet project, allowing you to perform more close and detailed discussions with other participants and demonstrate a live demo of your work or master classes. 

The format will be defined closer to the event due to the epidemic situation.
